# Task 6: REST API Rate Limiting

## Overview
Rate limiting is an essential technique used to control the amount of incoming requests to an API over a specified time period. This prevents abuse, ensures fair usage among clients, and protects backend resources from being overwhelmed.

## Requirements
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: The application must implement rate limiting for its API endpoints to prevent abuse.
2. **Rate Limit Policy**: Define a rate limit policy that restricts the number of requests from a single IP address within a defined time window.
